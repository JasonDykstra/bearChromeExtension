# bearChromeExtension
A chrome extension I made while following a tutorial

To add the extension to chrome, download the folder and go to chrome extensions. Click on developer mode in the upper right, then click load unpacked and select the downloaded folder. 

To use the extension, go to any number of pages, and whenever you feel like it go ahead and click on the icon for the extension in the upper right of chrome. This will open a new page that will show you all the pages you have visited recently and how many times the word "bear" has appeared on each one.
